# Flexbox Layout

## About

This simple webpage layout was created as a way to practice flexbox basics while taking [The Odin Project's Foundations course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) with the help of the [tutorial](https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/flexbox/) from [Interneting Is Hard](https://www.internetingishard.com/).
